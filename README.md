# Uplevl

**Uplevl is an AI-powered marketing automation platform built for small businesses.**

It is designed to streamline the marketing process for service providers, enabling them to save time, boost bookings, and accelerate growth. This is achieved through the automation of content creation, lead capture, and customer engagement across social media platforms and websites.

The process begins with a mobile uploader, allowing business owners to easily submit photos and brief descriptions. Uplevl's AI technology then transforms these uploads into high-quality social media content, scheduling it into targeted drip campaigns. Additionally, the AI responds to comments and direct messages, fostering engagement and interest.

As a result, these social media posts direct interested users to the business's website, where the AI Website Assistant assumes responsibility. This includes answering questions, capturing leads, and managing bookings seamlessly.

Ultimately, Uplevl oversees the entire marketing journey, from the initial content upload to the final customer conversion, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient marketing strategy.

## How It Works

1. **📱 Content Upload**  
   Business owners upload images and descriptions via Uplevl’s uploader. Files are securely handled via UploadThing.

2. **🤖 AI Post Generation**  
   Uplevl converts uploads into branded, engaging social media posts and schedules them across platforms using a drip campaign model.

3. **💬 Comment & DM Engagement**  
   The platform monitors comments and direct messages (DMs) on platforms like Instagram, automatically replying to increase engagement and drive interest.

4. **🌐 Website Handoff**  
   Engaged users are directed to the business’s website, where an embedded AI assistant interacts with them, handles bookings, and promotes offers.
