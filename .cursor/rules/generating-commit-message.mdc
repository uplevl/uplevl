When generating commit messages, follow these guidelines:

1. Keep all messages in lower case
2. Prefix each message with one of the following types:
   - `feat`: a new feature
   - `fix`: a bug fix
   - `docs`: documentation changes
   - `style`: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
   - `refactor`: code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
   - `test`: adding or modifying tests
   - `chore`: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc
   - `perf`: performance improvements
   - `ci`: changes to CI configuration files and scripts

3. Write messages in present tense
4. Keep the subject line under 50 characters
5. Use the imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")

Examples:
- "feat: add nav item for settings"
- "fix: resolve user authentication error"
- "docs: update api documentation"
- "chore: update node packages"
- "refactor: simplify user validation logic"

For breaking changes, add "BREAKING CHANGE:" in the message body followed by a description of the change.
