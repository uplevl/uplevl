# Commit Message Rules

## Format

All commit messages must follow this format:

```
<type>: <description>
```

## Type Prefixes

Use one of these prefixes based on the change:

- `feat:` - New features or functionality
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, dependencies, build processes

## Rules

1. **Single line only** - No multi-line descriptions or body text
2. **Lowercase** - All text must be in lowercase
3. **Present tense** - Use present tense (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
4. **Keep it short** - Since ClickUp ticket IDs are automatically added by pre-commit hooks, keep the message brief and focused
5. **No period** - Don't end with a period
6. **Migration Names** - Don't use the names of the migrations in commit messages, they are random names and don't reflect the changes made
7. **Multiple types** - If code changes reflect multiple commit type (feat,chore,fix), use `feat:` as the fallback
8. **Multiple changes** - When multiple changes are made, write a generalized message that captures the overall purpose rather than listing individual changes
9. **Avoid redundancy** - Don't repeat information that will be in the ticket ID

## Examples

✅ Good:

- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix: resolve login errors`
- `refactor: simplify data fetching`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `feat: implement post review system` (for multiple related changes)
- `fix: resolve ui issues` (when fixing multiple UI problems)

❌ Bad:

- `feat: Add user authentication` (capitalized)
- `fix: resolved login button not working` (past tense)
- `refactor: simplify user data fetching.` (ends with period)
- `feat: add user authentication, update login form, fix validation errors` (too detailed for multiple changes)
- `feat: add user authentication
This adds a new authentication system with JWT tokens` (multi-line)
- `update: something` (invalid prefix)
- `feat: add user authentication for CU-123456` (redundant ticket reference)
